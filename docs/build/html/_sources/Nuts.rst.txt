The NUTS modul is responsible for the visual presentation of geographic data based on the `NUTS`_-tiling. The main tool for the presentation is a map, but a bar- and line-plot are provided aswell. Apart from the plots, the datas presentation is controllable by several components to select a dataset and datapoint.

- The **Map** is for displaying the geographic distribution of the selected datapoint. It is also the way to select regions for the two other plots.
